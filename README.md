## Known bugs
It's a pretty static site right now, so there aren't any known bugs
## Core Functionalities Completed
- Text posts are visible
- Nothing else yet. We're just getting started, bucko
## Additional Challenges Finished
- It's styled up nice with html/css using Bootstrap, but it's not really my own styling yet, since I was following Corey Schafer's tutorial
## General Thoughts / Feedback on the Assignment
I can't give feedback until this is finished!
